# BTTF-TimeCircuitClock 
### Back To The Future Time Circuit Clock On Web

About two years ago, I attempted to construct a Time Circuit display... but the results were disastrous! 

However, I've dedicated my entire end of this year to rectify the timeline. ~~I carefully rebuilt the flux capacitor logic and calibration from scratch.~~

Even on your handheld mobile communicators, the display renders with absolute precision. It actually fits the screen.
